Building a validator widget using jQuery:
=========================================
Your job is to build a 'self validating input text box' widget using jQuery.
Clients would use your text field to construct higher level forms.
A client would use your text field like this:

	var my_textfield=new ValidatingTextField('#mydivid','name',function(value) {
			// this function returns true/false according
			// to whether the value passed to it passes validation
		}, 'error message to be shown in case of error');

Your widget would validate the text *on each keystroke*. If the validating
function returns false then the error message would be displayed. Otherwise
it would be hidden.

Write your widget using all of the techniques discussed (OO Javascript,
jQuery as the low level interface to the display, correct usage of
closures to tie the event handling to methods, etc).

Demonstrate the use of your widget by building a small form consisting of
several input fields.

Think: How can you improve the client API of your widget?
