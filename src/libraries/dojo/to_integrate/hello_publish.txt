dojo.connect publish/subscribe exercise
=======================================
Create an application with 5 buttons: subscribe1, unsubscribe1, subscribe2, unsubscribe2, publish. Also add a TextBox to hold some data.
At the begining the unsubscribe buttons are off.
Clicking on publish publishes the same event of a type you decide with the data taken from the textbox.
Subscribe1 subscribes on the event published and shows the data on the console using
console.debug.
Subscribe2 subscribes on the event published and shows the data using an alert.
Each unsubscribe unsubscribes the appropriate call.
Handle enable/disable status for the subscribe/unsubscribe buttons.
