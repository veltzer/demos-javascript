Create an Ext like paginated grid component.
The number of columns DOES NOT MATTER (for now...).
The grid should show a number of predefined rows (parameters on construction).
Two buttons should be shown below: next and prev.
A store is provided to the component on construction.
When ever the "next" button is pressed the next page out of the store is fetched
and shown in the table. Similar behaviour on "prev".
Grey the buttons out when "prev" or "next" is not relevant.
Receive the number of rows in the store from the store itself.
Receive the data from the store itself.
The data can be hard coded as hardcoded json on the server side.

Demonstrate the use of the your new component.
