You will be using the following concepts in this exercise:
1. hbox.
2. container.
3. event handling.
4. custom event declaration and firing.
5. event routing.
6. pagination.

Create a component that looks like this:

	PREV | Val1 | Val2 | Val3 | NEXT

The component will be connected to a store.
The component will always fetch the data that it needs for display
(not the entire data). use the store.nextpage
When ever next is called the next 3 element will be shown.
When ever prev is called the next 3 element will be shown.
Enable and disable the 'prev' and 'next' buttons appropriately.
When ever one of the fields is clicked publicize a 'select' high
level custom event with the id of the data that was selected.


Bonus: If you can wrap all of this up as a new component (Ext.define).
