<!--
A basic example showing the use of Ext.require

Note:
- You must do all of this in the context of Ext.onReady as the
Ext.require system does not work properly until the ExtJs framework
is ready.
- You can pass a single class to Ext.require as first parameter or
a whole array of classes. If passing a whole array then the function
will only be executed after ALL the members of the array have been
loaded. ExtJs actually tries to load independant classes IN PARALLEL
to speed up the load time from the server. Mind you that after first
time usage of your application the classes that you require will already
be in the browsers cache and so this speedup only applies to the very
first time when you run.
