- stuff that is missing from the extjs slides:
	- hello world source code and analysis.
	- ajax with extjs
	- layout managers: go into each of them.
		talk about flex.
	- more technical material in the mvc chapter.
	- finish the store according to the ext documentation.
		filters.
	- the Ext.util.Observable is Ext 3 based.
		move it to Ext.define instead of Ext.extend
		and fix it up.
	- Update the dom helper presentation.
	- talk about adding 'id' to widgets and finding them via Ext.getCmp('id')
	- talk about giving internal ids to widgets when writing widgets by using itemId: 'field1'
		and finding them using this.getComponent('field1')
	- talk about history (I already have an example almost ready).
- give order to the slides and create a syllabus from all of this mess!
