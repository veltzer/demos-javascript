<!--
	These are examples showing how 'document.write' works.

	Notes:
	- document.write writes to where the piece of code calling it
	is within the document.
	- you can use document.write to add html to the body.

<html>
	<head>
		<script>
			document.write('This is some text');
		</script>
	</head>
	<body>
		This is some html content
	</body>
	<script>
		document.write('This is some more text');
		document.write('<h1>this is a header</h1><p>This is a paragraph</p>');
	</script>
</html>
