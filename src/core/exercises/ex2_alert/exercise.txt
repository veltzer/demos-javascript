A better alert
==============
Do an example of a debug function which only prints the
debug message the first 3 times it is called via the 'alert'
function and then stops printing and stores the messages in an array. 
Use function properties and the call-once design pattern.
Demostrate the use of your new debug function.
Enable easy access to all the debug messages which are
not shown on the screen.

Bonus: rewire the native browsers 'alert' function to your implementation.
