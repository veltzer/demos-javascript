=======================
Add Ajax to your shopping cart application.
- Get the initial list of product and prices from the Server.
	do this on document load.
	the data should be in JSON format.
	use a JSON parser from json.org to parse the data.
- Add an "update" button that will get a new list of products
	from the server and update the screen.
- Add a "submit" button which submits your shopping cart
	to the server via HTTP POST.
