This is a multiple purpose exercise:
====================================
a. Work with the grid widget.
b. Inherit and customize the grid widget.
c. Add pagination to the grid widget.

a. Work with the grid wiget.
----------------------------
Create an application that uses the grid widget to show some
column/row based data. Make up what ever data you want.
Add a button that increments a specific cell within the grid
that has a numeric value.

b. Inherit and customize the grid widget.
-----------------------------------------
Inherit from the grid widget. Add a property "url" to the child and make the child fetch the data using Ajax from that URL.
The url on the server should look like "get_data?start=0,count=10"
Show 10 lines in the grid.

c. Add pagination to the grid widget
------------------------------------
Override the onKeyDown event on the child grid widget.
One key (n) would cause the widget to display the next 10 lines
from the server and another key (p) would cause the widget to
display the previous 10 lines from the server.
