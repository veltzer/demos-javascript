Write a publish/subscribe system.
=================================
This has nothing to do with UI.
This allows pieces of code in JS to communicate.
A publisher would call: publish(event,[data]);
A subscriber would call: subscribe(event,object,method);
The method 'method' on the object 'object' would be called whenever
an event is fired. The data would be passed to that method.

-Extra credit:
==============
- allow to unsubscribe.
- do it OO style.
- wrap in a singleton.
- allow to subscribe to methods/functions that know nothing about the pubish/subscribe subsystem.
