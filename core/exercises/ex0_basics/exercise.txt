1) split a string exercise.
	Write a function called split(s,c)
	that accepts a string and a character.
	The function returns an array of strings
	which represent the original string split according
	to the 'c' character.

	For instance:
	split('fooibarizoo','i')=['foo','bar','zoo']

2) statistics exercise.
	Receive an array of numbers.
	return the average, minium and maximum numbers for the array.
	
	Think: How can a function in JavaScript return more than one thing?

	For instance:
	min_max_avg([1,2,3,4,5])={ average: 3, minimum: 1, maximum: 5 }

3) function which gets a function (more advanced).
	Write a function which gets an array 'a' and a function 'f'.
	The function returns an array which has the results
	of running the function 'f' on the elements of the array 'a'.

	For instance:
	function square_it(x) {
		return x*x;
	}
	mapping([1,2,3,4,5],square_it)=[1,4,9,16,25]
