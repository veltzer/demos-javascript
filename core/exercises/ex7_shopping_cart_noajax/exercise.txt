Shopping cart: stage 1
======================
Shopping cart application: Write a shopping cart application where
the list of products and the shopping cart are held as
JavaScript client side objects.
1. Write an Inventory object which knows about product
	names, ids, prices and amounts in stock.
	e.g. 'basketball', 546, 34.56$ 'baseball', 547, 24.56$
	The inventory represents EVERYTHING that you
	have in stock.
2. Write a ShoppingCart object which knows about items,
	and quantities bought.
	e.g. [546, 2], [547, 2]
	which means I'm buying 2 basketballs and two
	baseballs. It can also calculate total price.
