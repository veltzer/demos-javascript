DOM (beginners)
===============
The idea of this exercise is to play a little bit with the DOM.

Create a page in which two fields of input exist.
Create a button.
Create an output area (any type you like).
When ever the user puts data into the two fields and presses the button,
add the two values in the fields and display the sum in the output area.

(see demo)
