A Tree exercise
===============
- Use dijit.Tree and create a tree.
- Add a text field.
- Use a dojo.data.ItemFileReadStore as the tree store and fetch the data
	from the server.
- Any time a click is made on the tree update the TextBox to show the selection.

- Solve the click issue in two ways:
	a. A direct click on the tree.
	b. publish/subscribe: subscribe on the tree id as the topic and get the
		event that way.
