dojo.connect exercise
=====================
Create an application with 3 buttons: connect, disconnect, click
At the begining the disconnect button is disabled.
At the begining the click does nothing.
When connect is called it uses dojo.connect so that when clicking
the "click" button an alert is shown. Connect then becomes disabled and disconnect
becomes enabled. Disconnect does the opposite and disconnects the event.
