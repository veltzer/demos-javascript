This is the coding style for the dojo examples:
===============================================
- description of the example at the begining of the html file like such:
	<!--
		This is a
		multi line
		comment about the example

		Mark Veltzer <mark.veltzer@gmail.com>
	-->
- every example should have a <title> tag so that it appears in the browser nicely.
