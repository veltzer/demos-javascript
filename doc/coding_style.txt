we use double quotes in both .html and .js files
	this is the HTML standard
	this is the google standard
	this is the standard in most languages

file names
	html files -> .html (this is the standard and the preferred)
	js file -> .js (this is the standard)
	html fragment files -> .html_frag (don't know of any standard for that).
	no spaces in file names "this_is_a_file_name.html"

tag names inside html
	should all be lower case
when a tag does not have content, it should have an early close:
	<button/>
	unless it's a tag in HTML that does not need closing (there is a list of about 5 of those).

js files will have the first line:
	#!/usr/bin/env node
	and will be chmodded +x

Js output
	printing will only be done via console.log
	it will not use "<br>" because there is not need to.
	document.write(...) will only be used when showing how document.write() works.
