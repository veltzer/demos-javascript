How to make the browser stop screaming at you for not declaring content type (usually UTF-8)
in your html?

- in your html (first way)
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html lang="en">
	<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8"/>

- in your html (second way)
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html lang="en">
	<head>
	<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"/>

- config your web server to send "Content-type" -> "utf-8" in the http headers
	it is sending.
