Building a spinner using jQuery
===============================
Create a "widget" using jquery.
The widget should show a text input box surrounded by two buttons.
The text input box will contain a number.
When the left button is pressed the number will decrease.
When the right button is pressed the number will increase.

Notes:
The widget should be a Javascript class (*NOT* a jQuery plugin).
The widget should have a convenient constructor with all the relevant parameters.
The widget should have various handy methods for updating the number,
	setting various limits etc.

Demonstrate your widget.

The Spinner widget should look like this:
	
	+-----+-----+-----+
	|  +  |  4  |  -  |
	+-----+-----+-----+
