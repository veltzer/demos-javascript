Create a widget using jquery which is a sophisticated submit button.

The button should be connected by the user to any number of validating
fields. Use the validating fields implemented in the previous exercise.

The button should listen on validation/invalidation messages from those
fields. If any field declares that it is invalid then the submittion
button should disable itself.

Here is how the client would use this new widget:

	var field1=new ValidatingTextField(...)
	var field2=new ValidatingTextField(...)
	var submitButton=new SubmitButton(
		"#mydivid",
		"text to show on the button"
	);
	submitButton.addField(field1);
	submitButton.addField(field2);

Second phase of the exercise:
=============================
Make the submit button collect the data from the all the fields
that it is in charge of and send it via Ajax to the server.
- use the jQuery .ajax function.
- get the data via some OO API - do NOT access the DOM directly ->
	let each field do it on its own.

Think: Can you extend this framework to other types of fields as well
	(not just text fields) ?

Third phase of the exercise:
============================
Use jquery animations to make the fields fly out of the right side
of the screen whenever the user clicks the submit button.

No help is provided about how to do this. Search the web.
