Building an auto-complete widget using jQuery:
==============================================
Build an auto-comlete text box. The text box will get the suggestions for
auto-completion from the server side.
Make your life easier developing this widget by having a hard coded list
of completion suggestions on the client side *and only then* switch
to doing real ajax with the server side.

Phase one
=========
First implement your widget as a straight input box.
When the user clicks, find a stuitable completion and modify the text
in the box to fit that completion.

The user will use your widget like this:
var my_textfield=new AutoCompleteTextField('#mydivid','name',[
	'alabama',
	'aidaho',

	'washington',
]);

Phase two
=========
Second implement your widget as a combo box.
When the user clicks something, find all the strings which have the prefix
that the user already typed in, and show then all in a combo box.

Phase three
===========
Get the suggestions from the server side.

Phase four - nicer UI
===========
Third implement your widget as a floating div.

The user will use your widget like this:
var my_textfield=new AutoCompleteTextField('#mydivid','name','complete.php');

The last parameter is a *server side url* to be used as completion.

Use JSON as the data transder format from client to server and back again.
