ExtJs Store beginner exercise
=============================
The purpose: work with a proxy and store to populate a combo box.

Create a combo box. Show it on the screen.
Create an Ext.data.Store.
Configure that store with a proxy to read the data in JSON format from the server side.
Put dummy data that on the server side that describes the states in US.
Connect the bombo box to the store by giving it a reference to the store in it's 'store' attribute.
See that the components work together to provide you with a box to select state names.

Note:
Use a standard JSON reader. The format for it's data is along these lines:
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Ed Spencer",
        "email": "ed@sencha.com"
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Abe Elias",
        "email": "abe@sencha.com"
    }
]

Phase 2:
========
- put the states on the "server" side in an unsorted order.
- What does the combo show?
- configure your store to do client side sorting.
	sample:
		var store = Ext.create('Ext.data.Store', {
		    model: 'User',
		    sorters: [
			{
			    property : 'age',
			    direction: 'DESC'
			},
		});
- is the combo sorted? How could you fix this?

Phase 3:
========
- make sure you have US state names on your server that begin with at least two letters.
- now only show states that begin with one of those letters.
- Use filters applied to the store.
	sample:
		var store = Ext.create('Ext.data.Store', {
			model: 'User',
			filters: [
				{
					property: 'firstName',
					value   : /Ed/
				}
			]
		});
- is the combo sorted? How could you fix this?
