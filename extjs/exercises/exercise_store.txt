Basic JSON read exercise
========================
1. write fake json data which is supposedly coming from the server.
	call it data.json.
	Write it in the right format (look at Ext.data.reader.Json).
	Put it somewhere on your server.
2. Create a model describing that data.
3. Create a store with a configured proxy to fetch that data.
4. Create a combo box and connect it to the store.

The end result should be a combo box allowing you to select an item
from data which is on the server side.
