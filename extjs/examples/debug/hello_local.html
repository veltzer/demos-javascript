<!--
A basic local hello world example for ExtJs
local means that the extjs code itself comes from the local server.

Note:
- the require is not needed since we get 'ext-all-debug.js' which brings
all the widgets with it.
- notice we write in the code in the 'head' section of the HTML file.
	That is recommended.
- we also demo Ext.onReady and Ext.MessageBox.
- you can choose between different versions of ext-all (see below).
- Notice that the box that you get is not a real window and rather drawn on the
main screen. This is to circumvent any browser limitations about pop up boxes.
- notice that we do not need to Ext.require('Ext.MessageBox') because
Ext.MessageBox is supplied by the 'ext-all.js' file.
