			Widgets event handling is pretty much similar to DOM nodes event handling.

			First of all in widgets event handling is realized by utilizing Ext.util.Observable mixin. In order to handle events properly your widget must containg Ext.util.Observable as a mixin. All built-in widgets (like Panel, Form, Tree, Grid, ...) has Ext.util.Observable as a mixin by default.

			For widgets there are two ways for assigning handlers. The first one is to use on method (or addListener). Let's for example create Button widget and assign click event to it. First of all you should check event's docs for handler's arguments:
		</div>
	</body>
